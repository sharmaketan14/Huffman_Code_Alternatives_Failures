#What are Huffman Codes?

Huffman codes were created by David A. Huffman.
In laymen terms, you enter a text file and it encodes it into bits which decreases file size, then we decode it again to get the raw text.
For every character these codes are unique, the concept uses priority queues and node creation.

For better ubderstanding of application of Huffman Encoding you check this video out.
